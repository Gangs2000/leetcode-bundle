We need to follow some rules while implementing Lambda Expression

    1. It can have 0, one or more than one parameters 
    2. Types of parameter depend upon the requirement
    3. Body of expression can be one or more than one line
    4. It it is more than one line then it should be enclosed by curly bracket
    5. Parentheses is not required if it is aving single parameter


    (parameters) -> 
    {
        Logic to process the data
    }



    1. Create an Empty Repository
    2. Clone The Empty Repository in your local machine
    3. Add the Project files inside the empty repository
    4. Open the Repository Folder
    5. Open Terminal from there and execute following commands
        1. git init
        2. git add .
        3. git remote set-url origin <repo URL>
        4. git commit -m "Repository Added"
        5. git push -u origin master


Stream: Flowing Data is called as Stream. A sequence of elements which is supporting different types of operations like parallel and aggregate. Source of Data 

    Intermediate 
    Terminal

    Layered architecture 

    Process1 | Process2 | Process3 | Process4  then get the final output 

    get the list of Files | Select the Directories |  Finally give the directory starting with A


    Stream Terminologies:

        Sequence of elements
        Source Of ELements
        Operations performed on stream elements
        Parallel and aggregate Operations
        Pipeline Operations
        Internal Iterations
